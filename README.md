## Features

- Lightweight, high-performance HTTP REST API
- Optimized database queries for speed and efficiency
- Secure JWT-based authentication
- Easy configuration via `.env` file
- Health check endpoint for liveness monitoring
- Docker-ready for seamless deployment

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (v1.x or newer)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional, for containerization)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) or any other supported database (if required)

---

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:vannsoklay/microservice-with-rust.git
cd microservice-with-rust
```

### 2. Build the Project

Compile the Rust microservice:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### 3. Configure Your Database

If using a database, ensure it is running and configured in your `.env` file.

### 4. Run Migrations (if applicable)

If your project uses Diesel for migrations:

```bash
diesel migration run
```

### 5. Start the Server

Launch the microservice:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

---

## Configuration

All configurations are managed via the `.env` file. Create one by copying the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Example `.env`:

```dotenv
MONG_DB="localhost:27017"
JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret"
PORT=8443
```

---

## Usage

### Starting the Microservice

```bash
cargo run --release
```

### Interacting with the API

You can use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or `curl` to test the endpoints. Example:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8443/health
```

| POST        | /api/resource        | Create a resource            |
| GET         | /api/resource/:id    | Retrieve a specific resource |

_Expand this section with more endpoints as needed._

---

## Testing

Run the unit and integration tests using:

```bash
cargo test
```

---

## Building a Docker Image (Optional)

To containerize your service:

```bash
docker build -t microservice-with-rust .
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 microservice-with-rust
```
