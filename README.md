## Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:vannsoklay/microservice-with-rust.git
cd microservice-with-rust

2. Build the Project
Run the following command to build the Rust microservice:

bash
Copy code
cargo build --release
3. Run Migrations (if using a database)
Ensure the database is up and configured in the .env file, then run migrations:
